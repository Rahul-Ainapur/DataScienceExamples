# DataScienceExamples
# This repository consists of examples I have worked on to showcase some data science methodologies as a part of my Applied Data Science coursework. 
# The Machine Learning and Regression code is used to work on a Sonar Data Set to find from the data if the object is Rock or the Mine by using Sonar sorrounds at different frequencies. I have used Pandas scatter matrix function which helps visualize the relationship between features. Similar classification example is done on the Wine data.
# The primary task of the project sklern is the creation of an sklearn model which will give good predictions on an unseen set of data. The creation of a model and its use on out-of-sample data is, at the end of the day, an important benchmark in the Data Science / Machine Learning process.
